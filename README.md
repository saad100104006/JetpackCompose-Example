We are building a simple application that checks for an account balance. Hereâ€™s how the app should  behave:

1. On app load, the app will ask for username and password.
2. When the user inputs his username and password, the app should call the login endpoints and if  successful, redirect to an account balance page.
If login is unsuccessful, show error on the login page.
3. If login is successful, use the token to call another endpoint to get the account balance and show the  balance.
